# Juvenile Salmon Fisheries-Independent Index

Data and code associated with species-specific indices accounting for variability in timing, location, and design of DFO High Seas/Basin Scale Coastal Interactions Surveys surveys. Manuscript (**Model-based indices of juvenile Pacific salmon abundance highlight species-specific seasonal distributions and impacts of changes to survey design**) in revision with **Fisheries Research**.

Scripts:
1. clean_bcsi.R: data cleaning and figures related to raw data
2. prep_prediction_grid.R: generate grid used for spatial predictions and index estimation
3. all_species_fit_season_mvrw.R: fit species-specific models and generate ms figures
4. par_recovery_sim.R: simulation exercise to evaluate recovery of fitted parameters
