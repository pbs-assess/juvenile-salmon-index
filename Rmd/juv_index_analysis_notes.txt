Juvenile Salmon Index Notes


July 20
- No clear evidence of unique spatial distribution in 2016 relative to other summer surveys

Meetings

July 21 - Meeting with Jackie King 

1-It sucks that week or month wouldn’t converge because I’m concerned about summer surveys starting later etc.  But perhaps it’s not really as much as a problem as I imagine it to be – i.e. that there isn’t enough variability to allow convergence, so why worry about week/month effects?

Tweaked somethings and this now works.

2-I like the spatial only effect, i.e. that there are areas of low abundance and high abundance among years.  That’s cool.

3-it’s weird that there are no fixed effects for IPES.  Why would that be?
Not sure what you're asking here...

4-why distance travelled, and not volume, for effort—I thought Amy had fixed missing net mensuration stuff
Volume would probably be better, but I don't think she sent it in the most recent data pull. 

5-I think I like summer index and fall index, since it helps to focus more on stocks present.


1. Model testing 
	- Step one is data in -- all data, spatially constrained (IPES grid), seasonally constrained, spatially and seasonally constrained
	- Step two is structure -- anisotropy vs. grid
	- Step three are covariates 
	- Step four is prediction
2. Next steps for analysis? Distribution map? CPUE index? When to meet w/ Sean?
3. Which dimensions of analysis to emphasize? Fixed effects vs. space vs. interannual
4. Who's writing this?
5. Get effort data from Amy
6. Do we incorporate stock-specificity? If so how and at what scale?
