Notes for Chinook Juvenile Indicators

June 2
- Fit initial spatial and spatio-temporal models
- Convergence issues 
	- Depth and bathymetry rel. highly correlated and including both terms lead to model convergence issues
	- Replaced smooth for month with factor due to convergence issues
	- Offset term resulted in errors
- ST model diagnostics look good and predictions seems reasonable
- Obvious shift in catch index with change in survey design 

June 3 
- Explore st models that include fixed effect for survey (HSS vs. IPES) and are constrained to summer months
